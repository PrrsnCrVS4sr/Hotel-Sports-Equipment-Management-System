# Hotel-Sports-Equipment-Management-System

A mini-project for DevCom using Django(REST)

The project is from the perspective of the Sport Equipment Lender

All the important methods, like POST,PUT,GET and DELETE has been implemented inside the api named 'sportseq'
The data from the api and its methods have been consumed inside the frontend by using the "requests" library in python.

Inside the front end, the lender can lend items to any person, via their roll numbers, return the item back to stock and also see
if the status of all the items. 
The front end is extremely barebones and has been designed using templates from the Bootstrap website
